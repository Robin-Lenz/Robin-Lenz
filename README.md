# Hello

Thanks for taking the time to explore my GitHub page! As a student at 42Berlin, I'm dedicated to sharing my progress and accomplishments through the projects showcased here. Your interest and feedback are always appreciated as I continue to refine and expand my coding skills.

If you are interested in what I can do in **C** have a look at my [42Berlin_C_projects](https://github.com/Robin-Lenz/42Berlin_C_projects) repository. The most interesting C project is [42Berlin_minishell](https://github.com/Robin-Lenz/42Berlin_minishell) in my opinion, because it was the project that helped me the most to level up my skills.
